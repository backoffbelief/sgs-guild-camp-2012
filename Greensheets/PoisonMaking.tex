{\bf Poison Making}

You have substantial skill in synthesizing poisons.  Many people think puffer fish are harmless, but you know just how wrong they are. You have the skills to create a potent poison that will kill anyone who ingests it. It is of course a latent poison; you wouldn’t want the person you poison to drop at your feet. That would cast entirely too much suspicion on you. The person will die about half an hour after consuming the poison. Be careful; there is no antidote.

In order to make a vial of poison you must:

{\bf 1.} Catch a puffer fish. To do this, improvise a net from a pasta strainer. Then spend 3 minutes within ZoC of a fish. Where have you seen water?

{\bf 2.} Obtain a vial in which to put the poison.

{\bf 3.} Use a mortar and pestle to make your poison. You know how to use a mortar and pestle. Spend 2 minutes with your hand on the sign for the mortar and pestle once you are in possession of the puffer fish and vial. Afterwards, destroy the puffer fish and vial and take a glass of poisoned wine.

%%% NOTE: make sure the fish item gets associated with the cube of water anomaly
