\startnotebook{\nPlayWithDad{}}

\begin{page}{pre}
This notebook is not transferable and explains how to play with dad. You may open it immediately upon start of game.
\end{page}

\begin{page}{first}

You are so excited about meeting your dad and getting to play with him. But first you need a toy. Find a {\bf ball}, then play catch with \cGroom{} for 3 minutes. Roleplay accordingly.  Once you're finished playing catch, you may turn to \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

That was so much fun, but playing ball isn't the only thing you'd like to do with your dad.  You love to color in school, so why not spend some time drawing with dad?  Acquire a set of {\bf crayons} and then color with \cGroom{} for 5 minutes. Roleplay accordingly. When you are done, you may turn to \nbref{third}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}

That was great, but now you have to play your all time favorite game ever, tic-tac-toe.  Find your dad and play with him until you have  each won 3 games.  Better not tell him though or he might lose to you on purpose! Afterwards, you may turn to \nbref{fourth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth}

Yay for playing thinking games like that. But you are restless again. I wonder if dad is into playing sports and running around? Play tag with dad and one other adult for 2 minutes. Once you are done you do so, turn to \nbref{fifth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}

Hanging out with dad is so much fun. If only he weren't going to marry that other lady. He really ought to get back together with mom. Spend 5 minutes in convesation with \cGroom{} and try to convince him not to marry that lady and get back together with mom instead. Once you've tried to convince him, turn to \nbref{sixth}

\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}

Congratulations, you have sucessfully played wiith dad! You are so excited that you just can't keep it to yourself. Tell everyone you see for the next 2 minutes (you only need to tell someone once) that you had such a great time playing with your dad!
