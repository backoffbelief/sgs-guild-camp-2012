Humanity is a dying race. We prospered for a time, but it turned out that our sun and Earth could support us for less time than we had hoped. Unfortunately, interstellar distances are vast and despite combining humanity's best minds, no easy solution was found: it was not possible to store enough energy to support a ship of awakened colonists, and cryogenic freezing was too volatile and power-hungry to last through the vast amounts of time required to reach another planet.

The human race did not take this news well and was not willing to so gracefully exit the galactic stage. If our biological forms were not suited to handle the ravages of interstellar travel, we would replace them with something else that could. Although the technology existed to transfer a human consciousness into a robotic body, it was decided that too much of our heritage would be lost if we existed only as robots on a barren spaceship. Instead, the decision was made to preserve humanity in a virtual environment. This is where you come in.

Your name is \cProgrammer{\they} and you were born in Pasadena, 12596 CE. You were widely hailed as one of the greatest savants of the century. When the decision was made that humanity would be preserved in virtual form, humanity turned to you. Programming and the mind-machine transfer are your specialties, and over the course of a decade you and a team of thousands of others built the most comprehensive computer system ever attempted. It was eventually installed on the ship \emph{New Eden}. Ultimately, the majority of humanity had their consciousness imprinted onto the system, and as the great simulation began, its host ship was launched to drift amongst the stars. You watched the great ship take off from the dying Earth. Shortly after not even the longest-range sensors on Earth could pick up the ship's signal, you happily passed away at an old age, your life's work completed.

Philosophers, politicians, and scientists debated for quite some time what nature the virtual world should take. Should it be a true post-scarcity utopia, free from trouble and death, with infinite resources for all? Should the new humanity start at 124th-century technology or something primitive like the Dark Ages of the 30th century? Ultimately,  it was decided that something critical to our existence would be lost if the world was free from adversity, and the world was constructed to be as close to ours as possible; no ``free and unlimited energy'' would be available, and the new humanity would start at the beginning of something approximating the Roman Empire. Importantly, although those initially uploaded were aware it was a simulation, a conscious decision was made to avoid passing down the knowledge of humanity's origin so that future generations would not feel their existence was in any way fake or a cheap imitation. You were a great opponent of the Utopians (those who pushed for an adversity-free world) and a great supporter of the New Beginning movement, which wanted to keep the fact that the world was a simulation from those inhabiting it.

A myriad of blinking lights flash before your face. You take a moment to get your bearings, and find yourself in a room approximating a hotel room from around 20th or 21st century humanity.
