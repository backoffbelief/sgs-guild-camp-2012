Your name is \cPassive{\they}. You are a prominent scholar of a galaxy-spanning species that calls themselves the \emph{Xenid}. Your species started off as an eight-legged species that relied upon bulky claws for fine-scale manipulation, but over the centuries your species shed its apprehension to large-scale genetic engineering and adoped a multisexual, bipedial, two-armed form that you copied from several other successful species. Your civilization is very powerful, but is in a war with a smaller but more advanced galaxy-spanning civilization called the \emph{Illithids}. The latest reports suggest you are losing the war and some of the planets on the border stars of your civilization are being conquered. This doesn't concern you too much; you are not a soldier and have little interest in the war. You come from your species home world which is quite far away from the war front and not likely to be threatened anytime soon. Your passion is learning and studying new things.

The majority of the Xenids, athough not strictly xenophobic, prefer to stay on Xenid-controlled planets and do not interact with other species. Depending on who you ask, you are either blessed or cursed with a personality that has no trouble interacting with foreign species. This gives you a clear advantage in the Xenid academic social circles --- while others tend to sit around analzying and debating data collected by others, you actively reach out and gather new data. Towards this end you joined \emph{Contact}, the exploratory and scouting branch of the Xenid government. Contacts primary goal is to gather data on new species: ``How technologically advanced are they?''; ``How does their government work?''; ``Are they a military threat?''; ``Are they a potential ally?'' There are lots of stars in the Milky Way and only some support life, so there are always plenty of uncharted stars out there.

Your current contact assignment is to investigate an unknown energy signature detected at a planetless blue dwarf star. You are in a two-person vessel, and your partner is \cAlien{\they}. He is a soldier from one of the border star systems. His home planet is currently under siege and has possibly already fallen. In your previous encounters with him, you have found him to be very focused on finding allies or military technology from other civilizations to help with your war against the Illithids, to the point where he is willing to violate some of the conventions designed to prevent large-scale conflict resulting from a first-contact gone sour.

On your way to the blue dwarf, you picked up what you believed to be an unknown ship traveling at a very high fraction of the speed of light on long-range sensors. You and \cAlien{\they} debated for some time what action to take. You argued that the unknown ship was clearly not interested in being discovered, and might destroy your small scout ship.
