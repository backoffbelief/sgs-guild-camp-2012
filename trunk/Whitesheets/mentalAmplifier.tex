\emph{(This counts as a transferable ability)}

This is a stack of research notes on how to build a mental amplifier, which increases a wearer's brain patterns so they are easier to read by other machines such as MRIs. If you are not the original owner of this whitesheet, you will have to spend five minutes studying it.

This is meant to be completed in a suitably-equipped workshop, but you think it might be possible using household materials. To create the ``Completed mental amplifier'' (Item \#774), you will need to spend five minutes and possess the following items:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The  \bf{Incomplete mental amplifier} (Item \#773)
\item A \bf{solenoid} (often found in television sets)
\item Some \bf{copper wire}
\item Some \bf{steel wool}
\end{enumerate}

Completing the mental amplifier will destroy all of these items. You can see a GM to receive the item card, or simply modify Item \#773.
