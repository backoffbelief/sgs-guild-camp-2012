\emph{(This counts as a transferable ability)}

This is a stack of research notes on how to build a head-mounted display, and modify it to read and respond to the mental patterns of the wearer. If you are not the original owner of this whitesheet, you will have to spend five minutes studying it.

This is meant to be completed in a suitably-equipped workshop, but you think it might be possible using household materials. To create the ``Completed head-mounted display'' (Item \#772), you will need to spend five minutes and possess the following items:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The  ``Incomplete head-mounted display'' (Item \#771)
\item A \bf{processor} (often found in personal laptops)
\item A \bf{magnet}
\item A \bf{soldering iron}
\end{enumerate}

Completing the head-mounted display will destroy all of these items. You can see a GM to receive the item card, or simply modify Item \#771.
