This greensheet details how to change your $\omega$-stat.

\begin{enum}[lowering]
  \item Any time you touch anything with a gold star  on it for more than 10 seconds, subtract 1 from your $\omega$-score.
  \item Your $\omega$-score cannot be lowered by an object with a gold star on it within one minute of the last time you were lowered by that same object.
  \item If an ability tells you to lower your $\omega$-score, subtract 1 from your $\omega$-score.

\end{enum}

The $\omega$-stat cannot be raised, unless you know otherwise.
